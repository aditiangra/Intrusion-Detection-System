# Intrusion-Detection-System
It is our thesis project in which we developed an intrusion detection system and integrated it with web application.This system classifies the traffic of a site as a normal traffic or a type of attack like DOS attack,probe attack, teardrop attack.
# DOS Attack
a denial-of-service attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network.
# SYN Attack
A SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker rapidly initiates a connection to a server without finalizing the connection. The server has to spend resources waiting for half-opened connections, which can consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.
# Sinkhole Attack
In this attack, the intruder attracts the neighbor nodes with forged routing information, and then performs selective forwarding or alters the data passing through it. 
## Built With
Jupyter Notebook<br>
Tkinter<br>
Pandas<br>
Numpy<br>
Sklearn<br>
# We divided the whole project into 4 phases
<b>PHASE 1</b><br>
Using Netsim Simulator, which creates a simulated environment for IOT assaults, we collected the dataset during the first phase.Users of Test Universe can use transient signals generated by NetSim to test how protective devices will respond in the case of a realistic fault.<br>
<b>PHASE 2</b><br>
On the data, we applied data preparation techniques, beginning with managing missing values, categorical data, and ordinal data.
After creating a correlation matrix and used Pearson Correlation, to chose relevant features.
To eliminate excessive fitting and underfitting, we performed bagging and boosting.<br>
<b>PHASE 3</b><br>
The accuracy of each machine learning model was then determined by using a variety of training models.<br>
<b>PHASE 4</b><br>
Then, using Python's Tkinter, we created a GUI where users could upload datasets, train models, receive accuracy results, and hear beeps whenever an attack node appeared in the network.
We finally receive the excel sheet with all the attack IP addresses.<br>
